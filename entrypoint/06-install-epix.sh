# 06-install-epix.sh -- the Fedora packages ePiX needs, both to build it from source
# (install-epix.sh) and to run it: ePiX is a C++ figure library whose `epix`/`elaps`
# drivers compile each figure source (.xp) with g++ at RUN time and typeset it with
# latex -> dvips -> ghostscript, so the compiler and the TeX stack are runtime
# dependencies, not just build ones. Gated by the Dockerfile's USE_EPIX ARG (the
# `make test` gate needs none of this). Host-runnable: run it, then install-epix.sh.

#   gcc-c++ binutils         compile libepix; g++ also compiles .xp figures at runtime

#                            TikZ (pgf) backends some figures emit. Overlaps gacalc's
#                            03-install-notebook-tex.sh (latexrecommended, fontsrecommended,
#                            pgf) -- dnf treats the overlap as a no-op -- and is listed in
#                            full so an epix-only image (USE_JUPYTER=0 BUILD_DOCS=0) still
#                            has `latex`.
