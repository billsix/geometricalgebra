# install-epix.sh -- fetch the maintainer's ePiX mirror (github.com/billsix/epix-mirror)
# at ONE pinned commit, install the C++ library + drivers into /usr/local with Meson,
# then build its Python front-end (the nanobind extension) and install the `epix`
# package into /venv, so the book's figures can be written in Python the way
# epix-mirror's own notebooks are. Run after 06-install-epix.sh (the build + runtime
# packages). Host-runnable: on a bare Fedora host with a /venv, run both as root.
#
# The commit comes from the environment -- the Dockerfile passes its EPIX_COMMIT ARG
# explicitly (`RUN EPIX_COMMIT=$EPIX_COMMIT install-epix.sh`), so the pin lives in one
# place (the Dockerfile) and a bare-host run must name it too. Pinning to a commit, not a
# branch, is what makes the image layer reproducible; bump the ARG to move it.
#
# The fetch is a shallow fetch of exactly that commit (GitHub serves reachable SHAs), so
# the layer holds one tree, not the history. The tree is fetched to /epix -- the path
# epix-mirror's own entrypoint/build_py.sh hard-codes, which is why that script can be
# reused unchanged to build the extension against the installed libepix (the Meson
# build dir is removed first so it links the INSTALLED library) -- and then MOVED to
# /opt/epix-src before the Python package is installed editable from its python/ dir
# (the extension's .so sits inside that package dir). The move matters: a directory
# named `epix` in `/` would be found by Python as an empty namespace package whenever
# the cwd is `/` (sys.path[0]) and would shadow the installed package -- exactly what a
# Dockerfile RUN's cwd is. The source stays in the image (small; samples/ and notebooks/
# are the reference for writing figures). This runs at IMAGE-BUILD time -- network is
# used here and never at run time, per the "deps fetched at build, offline thereafter" rule.
